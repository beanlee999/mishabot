For other instances where you need to perform daily functions from within the room, for example, collect meals, have laundry changed or clear trash, below are simple tips that you can follow, so as to ensure the safety of your household members supporting you with managing these daily necessities:
Ensure no one from the household is near the doorway to your room
Put on a surgical mask before opening the door
Handle your items in ways to reduce the need for family members to come into direct contact with them as much as possible, such as:
Dedicate a set of utensils for your meals, do not share dishes, drinking cups, cutlery etc. Your family may wash your used utensils together with theirs; 
Place your laundry in a bag at your door. Your family may wash your soiled laundry together with theirs, but they should empty your bag of laundry directly into the washing machine and avoid handling your soiled clothes with their bare hands;
Place your secured, double-bagged trash at the door for your family to help dispose of. Your family should throw the bag directly into the rubbish chute immediately;
Inform the other members of the household of the above, so they can collect the rubbish/laundry/eating utensils
Wash your hands with soap and water regularly or where applicable.
If you do not have an attached bathroom within the isolation room, ensure everyone practices proper hygiene and disinfects the bathroom after each use. These are some examples to help the household manage: 
designate specific bathroom for the patient’s usage and other household members should use another bathroom;
if a single bathroom has to be shared, after use, lower the lid before flushing. User should clean and disinfect after each use for contact surfaces and do not use for at least 20 minutes immediately after the patient’s usage. 
If you live alone and need to collect deliveries at the door, below are simple tips that you can follow:
Place a hook at the door and ask the delivery man to hang the delivered groceries or food there for contactless delivery;
Ensure that the delivery man has left and no one is within the vicinity of your doorway;
Put on a surgical mask before opening the door;
Collect your deliveries and close the door;
Do not interact with anyone;
Wash your hands with soap and water regularly or where applicable.",home recovery

Should one avoid public places where there have been confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 cases?,NEA/001,"There is no need to avoid public areas. For all public and residential spaces exposed to confirmed 2019 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) cases, NEA officers have been deployed to supervise the cleaning and disinfection works, to ensure that they were performed in accordance with NEA guidelines. 

As a precautionary measure to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-2019, NEA has issued sanitation and hygiene advisories to premises and facilities with high public access – such as hotels, commercial buildings, FB outlets (including hawker centres), and Town Councils. Officers from NEA and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) have been visiting hawker centres, to guide hawkers on the proper cleaning and disinfection of their premises. Town Councils have also stepped up on their cleaning and disinfection regime of common areas, to ensure a high level of public health hygiene.

We would like to remind everyone to always observe good hygiene practices, like properly binning used tissues and waste, keeping dining tables clean, and returning trays along with soiled crockery after meals, to keep viruses at bay.

We also advise members of the public to not speculate and/or spread unfounded rumours. Please visit this page (www.moh.gov.sg) for updates on COVID-19 situation.",coronavirus

Personnel responsible for cleaning and disinfection of areas frequently used by the confirmed case, need to wear PPE consisting of: disposable long-sleeved gowns, disposable gloves, eye goggles or face shields, and N95 masks. Once soiled or damaged, gloves should be removed and discarded, and a new pair used after they have washed their hands with soap and water. It is important that cleaners observe strict hand hygiene and not touch any part of their face.
After cleaning and disinfection has been completed, cleaning personnel should remove their PPE, and immediately wash their hands with soap and water. For more information, please refer to the Interim guidelines for environmental cleaning and disinfection of areas exposed to confirmed case(s) of COVID-19 in non-healthcare premises.

Residences that may be exposed to the COVID-19: These places are residences of persons placed under Home Quarantine Order by the Ministry of Health, or spaces which have been exposed to confirmed cases.

If the candidate is symptomatic and has been prescribed a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test by a healthcare professional to assess for COVID-19 infection, the candidate should continue to self-isolate till the PCR result is out and is negative.

On the day of examination, candidates must take a self-swab ART at home and show a photo of their ART kits with negative result, with date of ART taken indicated on the test kit, that are placed next to their ID to the invigilators on arrival.

Can my child use a face shield instead of a face mask in school?,MOE/830,"COVID-19 is spread predominantly through droplets. The design of face shields typically leaves a gap between the face shield and the face which droplets can pass through, whereas masks that are worn closely and completely over the nose and mouth do not have such gaps.

However, MOH also recognises that in some situations, the wearing of face masks may not be practical, and exemption has been given for certain groups of students/children as follows:

Children twelve years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time;
Older students who have certified health conditions that may result in breathing or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time. This includes some students with special needs that make it challenging for them to wear face masks.

"Given the number of students that have been infected with COVID-19, why is MOE resuming more activities such as CCAs in secondary schools, JCs, MI and IHLs?",MOE/831,"The majority of student and school staff cases were infected by their household members or through social interactions outside of the school or IHL setting.

In view of the progressive increase in the proportion of students who are fully vaccinated, we are gradually allowing more activities to resume in secondary schools, JCs, MI, SPED schools (for the senior/secondary sections) and IHLs, as these student activities are essential for learning, as well as the social and emotional development of our students.

Can students engage in strenuous activities after their vaccination?,MOE/844,"Given the emerging data on the small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis* observed after vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the Expert Committee on COVID-19 vaccination recommends that all vaccinated persons, in particular adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their first and second vaccination doses.

In line with the Expert Committeeís recommendation, students should also avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their first and second doses.

Examples (non-exhaustive) of strenuous physical activity to avoid are:

Swimming
Cycling
Running
Lifting heavy weights
Competitive sports
Ball/racket games
During this time, students should seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.

Students should inform their PE, relevant CCA and other teachers about the date of their vaccination so that they will be exempted from physical activities for a week.

While most persons with vaccine-related myocarditis observed locally and internationally have mild symptoms and make an uneventful recovery, it is possible that the condition may be aggravated by factors or strenuous activities that may affect the heart.

*Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions affecting the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively. Patients often present with symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.",

What adjustments have been made to ensure that students are not unduly penalised in terms of their co-curricular records and LEAPS 2.0 attainment?,MOE/882,"MOE has implemented a set of measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the co-curricular records of primary school and pre-university students, as well as the LEAPS 2.0 attainment for secondary school students.

For the LEAPS 2.0 framework, which recognises the holistic development of secondary students, adjustments have been made to the four domains ñ Achievement, Leadership, Participation and Service ñ so that students will continue to be recognised for their involvement in co-curricular activities (CCA).

Under the Achievement domain, MOE has implemented a special provision to recognise all students for Representation and Accomplishment as long as they have been selected to represent their school this year for any competition, performance or event (e.g. National School Games, Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation etc.). This is regardless of the completion status and outcome of their involvement in these activities.

For example, for Uniformed Groups, badgework and promotion requirements will be adjusted to allow students to pursue their rank promotions and badges through online learning modules.

Under the Participation domain, students' CCA attendance will be pro-rated based on the total number of CCA sessions that have been conducted by the school. Students who were absent with valid reasons due to disruptions caused by COVID-19 will not be penalised.

Under the Service domain, schools will continue to recognise students for their involvement in Values in Action (VIA) activities and projects, time spent on planning, discussing and refining as well as reflection components of their VIA project.",

Do all students and staff need to get tested for COVID-19?,MOE/883,"Anyone who is unwell, especially if they display respiratory symptoms such as runny nose, cough or sore throat, should see a doctor.

Staff and students (13 years and above), if diagnosed by the doctor to have Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) and require COVID-19 testing, will be referred by the doctor to a polyclinic, designated GP clinic participating in the Swab-and-Send-Home (SASH) initiative or Regional Screening Centre set up by the Health Promotion Board to undergo a test. This also applies to personnel working in schools but who are not MOE-hires, such as SCC/KCare staff, coaches and instructors, canteen and bookshop operators. A list of GP clinics participating in the SASH initiative can be found at the following website: http://www.phpc.gov.sg.

Students aged 13 to 16 should be accompanied by a parent/guardian for the test. This facilitates consent-taking and communication to both the student and parent/guardian on the precautions to take note of while awaiting the test results at home.

Students and staff who are unwell with flu-like symptoms, are required to stay away from school. They should seek medical attention immediately and be tested for COVID-19. Unwell individuals should remain at home until they are tested negative for COVID-19.
Students and staff who have household members on Quarantine Order/Stay Home Notice or have children or adult household members with flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough, are required to stay away from school.
Students should have their TraceTogether token or app with them throughout the school day to facilitate accurate contact tracing, should the need arise. However, students will not be denied entry to school if they forget to bring their TT token. Do note that TT Tokens or Apps will be required for student participation in out-of-school activities where SE check-ins are carried out via TT-only SE.
Hygiene

Frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces and disinfection of the premises to be done daily.
Students will continue to practise frequent hand-washing throughout the school day and wipe down of tables and shared equipment after use.
Mask wearing

All students and staff will be required to wear masks at all times. Students and staff should wear masks with good filtration capability such as surgical masks or reusable masks of equivalent effectiveness that are made of at least two layers of fabric.
Young children are to wear masks, unless they are unable to due to pertinent special needs or medical conditions.
For physical education classes, primary schools will only conduct individual mask-off activities outdoors, while secondary schools/JCs/MI can conduct mask-off activities in groups of up to two outdoors.
Mask-off music and drama classes will be suspended. Schools with O/A-level Music candidates will continue with examination preparations with testing.
Schools will adhere to guidelines on ventilation for regular air flow exchange and the use of air purifiers in air-conditioned venues.
Safe Distancing

As a precautionary measure, they will be issued a 14-day Leave of Absence, to minimise the risks of further transmission in schools. The affected schools will also be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.

These measures have proven to be effective in limiting the transmission of virus in our schools. Students and staff who are unwell know that they should not be going to school. Our teachers also carefully monitor themselves and their students, and any staff or student showing symptoms will be immediately isolated and sent to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Our schools and teachers will continue to implement the necessary safe management and precautionary measures, to reduce risks as much as possible.",
What action will MOE take if there are any confirmed case(s)/clusters in school?,MOE/897,"If there is a new confirmed case in the school, our schools will take the necessary measures to safeguard students and staff and curb the risk of any transmission, which include issuing Leave of Absence (LOA) quickly to close contacts, and to students from the same classes or CCA groups of confirmed cases.

MOE will work closely with MOH to identify all close contacts of the confirmed case and determine whether staff, students and visitors will need to undergo precautionary swab tests. Close contacts will also be issued Quarantine Orders (QOs) by MOH.

Any staff or students who show any symptoms will be required to go to their nearest doctor for treatment and, if necessary, swab tests.

These measures will help to break the chain of transmission, while supporting our students to ensure they can continue their learning. When the school's situation has stabilised, students and staff can return to the school to continue face-to-face lessons (arrangement will depend on the situation).",

However, this is disruptive. Students will have different teachers and less time with the subject teachers since we would have to reduce periods to fit two sessions.

In addition, these measures may not be critical to manage risks in the school context at this juncture, as we have many other safe management measures in place. These include having students stick strictly to their classes, minimising contact between students in class, and emphasising good hygiene and proper mask-wearing in common areas. We will also maintain safe distancing through queue markers and alternate seating in canteens, plus stagger arrival and dismissal times to ease congestion.",
Why are we not disinfecting shoes and clothing of students?,MOE/900,"MOH has shared that there is currently no evidence that spraying disinfectant on a fully clothed individual would 'disinfect' the individual.

From 11 October 2021, MOH will issue 7-day Health Risk Warning (HRW) to students in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, in line with Protocol 3 of the 1-2-3 protocols#. Such students can return to school during the 7 days if they continue to be well and have a negative Antigen Rapid Test (ART) result before they leave for school daily.

MOE will no longer issue Leave of Absence (LOA) and Approved Absence (AA) for MOE Kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools (including SPED schools), JCs / MI. This means students and staff currently under existing Quarantine Orders, LOA or AA can return to school for lessons as long as they are well and have a negative ART test result on the day they go to school. IHLs will similarly take alignment with MOH's revised protocols. This is in line with the national approach to living with COVID-19.

The table below provides an overview of the updated categories of precautionary measures in schools and IHLs, in effect from 11 October 2021:

Category	Arrangements
Confirmed Case	Not allowed to attend school / campus until the end of Isolation Order.
Stay-Home Notice (SHN)	Not allowed to return to school / campus until the end of SHN.
Health Risk Warning (HRW)	Follow national Protocol 3 and allowed to return to school / campus after the first negative ART self-test, and negative ART results daily for the next 7 days, prior to leaving home.
#For more information on the 1-2-3 protocols, please refer to Annex C in MOH's press release on 9 October.",
My child has been placed on Quarantine Order (QO)/Leave of Absence (LOA)/Approved Absence (AA) earlier. Under what circumstances can my child return to school?,MOE/907,"Students who have been issued with QO, LOA or AA may return to school from 11 October as long as they are well and with a negative Antigen Rapid Test (ART) result on the day they go to school.",

What happens if there is a confirmed case in my child's class?,MOE/908,"For MOE Kindergartens and Primary Schools:

As MOE Kindergarten children and most primary school students are not vaccinated, MOE Kindergartens and primary schools will continue to actively identify close contacts of COVID-19 cases in school and require them to undergo regular testing while waiting for the issuance of a Health Risk Warning (HRW) by MOH. Under this arrangement for Close Contact Testing (CCT):

Identified students should stay at home but may return to school if they are well and have a negative ART result before they leave for school daily.
As this is meant to be a bridging measure while awaiting the issuance of HRW by MOH, students will be placed on CCT for a period of 5 days.
If HRW is not issued during the 5 days, the CCT will be lifted, and the student need not perform further testing.
In line with the move to living with COVID-19, school staff would not be calling parents to inform them of CCT. Schools will use electronic means (e.g. Parents Gateway or email) instead. Schools will conduct deep cleaning of the facilities and will inform you if the class has to be on 1 day of HBL to do so.

For Secondary Schools/Junior Colleges/Millennia Institute:

MOH will contact trace through the TraceTogether App/Token and will issue your child a Health Risk Warning directly if he/she is a close contact. Schools will conduct deep cleaning of the facilities and will inform you if the class has to be on 1 day of HBL to do so.",

What is a Health Risk Warning (HRW)?,MOE/909,"Previously, contacts of COVID-19 cases were differentiated into various risk levels and there were several measures imposed, such as Quarantine Order (QO), Health Risk Alert (HRA), and Health Risk Warning (HRW). There will now be a single approach ñ a HRW that lasts seven days from the day of its issuance, that is based on ART self-testing. It will comprise following national Protocol 3:

Upon being notified of the HRW (Day 1), the person should immediately self-isolate, and test himself with an ART on the day of the HRW issuance and upload the Day 1 ART result based on the instruction in the HRW notification.
The person on HRW can continue with normal activities for the day if the test is negative.
For subsequent days, i.e. Day 2 to 7, the person on HRW should test ART negative on same day before going out.
If the person on HRW tests positive on any of these ART tests, he should follow national Protocol 2#.
On Day 7, he must test himself with an ART, and if the test is negative, there is no further need for tests after that.

What should my child do if an ART positive test result is obtained when he/she is well?,MOE/910,"Students who are well and who have been administered the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) and obtained a positive test result, should self-isolate at home for 72 hours before repeating the ART. Students may resume daily activities, including coming to school, if the second ART is negative. If the second ART is also positive, students should continue to self-isolate and repeat the ART daily until it is negative.

Students and their household members should seek medical attention immediately if they are unwell with flu-like symptoms. As part of being socially responsible, students who are unwell should not return to school and should practise good personal hygiene both in school and at home.",

PEIs are strongly encouraged to take reference from the plans and safe management measures for ECDA-registered preschools, MOE schools and IHLs, if they wish to adopt measures that are tighter than national SMMs.

PEIs with clarifications should approach SkillsFuture Singapore at CPE_Registration@ssg.gov.sg.",
What are the safe management measures that should be implemented for tuition and enrichment centres that are allowed to continue on-site instruction?,MOE/925,"In line with the national posture, all tuition and enrichment centres must ensure that work-from-home is the default arrangement for employees who are able to do so. During this period, the 10-day snap work-from-home regime will be suspended. MOE strongly encourages that all tuition and enrichment classes be conducted online.

For centres that are allowed to continue on-site instruction, to reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19, they are required to abide by the nationwide safe management measures for workplaces. These include the use of SafeEntry to support contact tracing for all employees, wearing of masks at all times, no social gatherings at the workplace and regular cleaning of common facilities and high-touch areas. Employers should continue to implement flexible working hours and stagger the start times of employees who need to return to the workplace. Employees who are unable to work from home are strongly encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART), to keep the workplace safe. Employees who are able to work from home but need to return to the workplace for adhoc reasons may do so after testing negative via ART before returning onsite. Details are available at the GoBusiness website (https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/general).

As part of Singapore's national efforts to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19, enterprises in the Private Tuition and Enrichment Sector are required to comply with the FET 7-day regime, as well as the VoRT regime for onsite employees. The latest details on the two regimes are on: https://go.gov.sg/tuition-enrichment-fet.

As a default, the following SMMs apply to all centres conducting on-site instruction (whether indoors or outdoors and regardless of activity), except where there are additional SMMs that apply for higher-risk activities such as sports or physical activity, dance, singing, the playing of instruments that require the intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind/brass instruments), voice training, and speech and drama classes (please refer here for details on additional SMMs for high movement activities or activities which carry a higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread, and here for classes that involve mask-off activities).

Safe distancing. Safe distancing measures for centres which are allowed to continue on-premise instruction are:
Students: Centres must ensure safe distancing between students by putting up appropriate floor demarcations and/or physical barriers, e.g. using safety tape. There must also be strict separation between students in different classrooms at all times, with no intermingling.
As a default, centres must ensure that all students maintain safe distancing of at least 1m at all times, with strictly no physical interaction between students.
If it is not possible to apply 1m safe distancing between students and some interaction is unavoidable, centres may instead organise students into groups of no more than 2 students, with strictly no physical interaction or intermingling between different groups. Centres must strictly maintain a minimum of 1m spacing between groups, although MOE advises 2m spacing between groups as a best practice.
Tutors/instructors: Tutors/instructors are advised to minimise contact with students, If some interaction is unavoidable, contact with students should be transient, and they should remain at the front of the class as much as is practicable.
Capacity: No single room within a centre should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors, even as the above measures are adopted.
Centres are also reminded that per MOM's guidelines for workplaces, should there be staff deployed on site, centres must ensure that there is be no cross-deployment across worksites. No staff should work at more than one worksite to reduce the risk of infection caused by inter-mingling. More information on prevailing workplace SMMs can be found on the MOM website (https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures).
Health declarations. Centres should not permit students who are placed on Leave of Absence or Approved Absence by their schools, or students and staff who are on Health Risk Warning, Health Risk Alert, Stay Home Notice, or Home Quarantine Order to enter the centre. We also advise centres to watch out for staff and students with fever or respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, breathlessness, runny nose, loss of sense of smell, cough, or sore throat. Staff and students with the above symptoms or who are unwell should be advised to leave the centre and see a doctor immediately, and should not be allowed to attend lessons. As a best practice, centres should also check if a family member living in the same household is unwell. If so, the child should not attend lessons in person.
Disinfection of surfaces. All surfaces in classrooms must be thoroughly disinfected between classes. Sharing of all equipment (e.g. props, microphones) should be avoided as far as possible. If this cannot be done, the equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and/or disinfected before being handled or used by others. However, please note that sharing of wind/brass instruments or parts thereof (e.g. mouthpieces, reeds) is not allowed.
Masks must be worn as a default at all times, except for persons allowed to use face shields instead of masks (e.g. persons with health conditions resulting in breathing/medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period). Instructors are expected to wear a surgical mask or reusable masks of equivalent effectiveness at all times.

"Will the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system and the SafeEntry Gateway Device (SEGW) be implemented for tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers?",MOE/935,"On 4 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced that TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SafeEntry) will be implemented at all venues that experience higher throughput of visitors, and/or where people are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods from 17 May 2021. The TT programme and SafeEntry are important digital tools that enable contact tracers to quickly identify and isolate close contacts of COVID-19 cases. This helps to break transmission chains and prevent community outbreaks. TT tokens may be collected at designated collection points (please refer to https://token.gowhere.gov.sg for more information).

Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers must therefore ensure that TT-only SafeEntry is implemented in your premises, and that entry to your centres will be allowed only if the individual uses their TT App to scan the centreís QR code or presents the QR code on the TT token to be scanned. This includes staff, students aged 7 years and above, parents and other visitors.

It is mandatory for all tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers to deploy SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) to facilitate SafeEntry (SE) check-in for students aged 7 years and above, parents, staff and visitors, and help users check that their TT token is working. Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers are reminded to download the SafeEntry (Business) app to use the SEGW function or register for a SEGW box on the SE website (go.gov.sg/gateway-overview). Centres should maintain attendance records for children below 7 to facilitate contact tracing if required.

At the point of entry into the centres, if any student forgets to bring their TT token, they should be asked to download the TT app on their phones before they are allowed entry. However, if the student is unable to do so (e.g. phone is out of battery), the studentís personal details should be noted down as a last resort, before the individual is granted entry. The centre should retain all such records for at least a month to facilitate contact tracing if necessary.

Business may refer to the SafeEntry User Guide for requirements on how to scan the TT tokens, available at https://www.safeentry.gov.sg (please navigate to Resources > User Guide > SafeEntry NRIC User Guide for Business). Updates may also be found at https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/media-hub/press-releases.",
