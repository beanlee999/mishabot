This means food/groceries will need to be delivered for the household. You should also maintain a high level of personal hygiene by washing your hands regularly with soap and practice good bathroom etiquette, e.g. close the lid before you flush. 
For other instances where you need to perform daily functions from within the room, for example, collect meals, have laundry changed or clear trash, below are simple tips that you can follow, so as to ensure the safety of your household members supporting you with managing these daily necessities:
Ensure no one from the household is near the doorway to your room
Put on a surgical mask before opening the door
Handle your items in ways to reduce the need for family members to come into direct contact with them as much as possible, such as:
Dedicate a set of utensils for your meals, do not share dishes, drinking cups, cutlery etc. Your family may wash your used utensils together with theirs; 
Place your laundry in a bag at your door. Your family may wash your soiled laundry together with theirs, but they should empty your bag of laundry directly into the washing machine and avoid handling your soiled clothes with their bare hands;
Place your secured, double-bagged trash at the door for your family to help dispose of. Your family should throw the bag directly into the rubbish chute immediately;
Inform the other members of the household of the above, so they can collect the rubbish/laundry/eating utensils
Wash your hands with soap and water regularly or where applicable.
If you do not have an attached bathroom within the isolation room, ensure everyone practices proper hygiene and disinfects the bathroom after each use. These are some examples to help the household manage: 
designate specific bathroom for the patientÕs usage and other household members should use another bathroom;
if a single bathroom has to be shared, after use, lower the lid before flushing. User should clean and disinfect after each use for contact surfaces and do not use for at least 20 minutes immediately after the patientÕs usage. 
If you live alone and need to collect deliveries at the door, below are simple tips that you can follow:
Place a hook at the door and ask the delivery man to hang the delivered groceries or food there for contactless delivery;
Ensure that the delivery man has left and no one is within the vicinity of your doorway;
Put on a surgical mask before opening the door;
Collect your deliveries and close the door;
Do not interact with anyone;
Wash your hands with soap and water regularly or where applicable.",home recovery

Should one avoid public places where there have been confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 cases?,NEA/001,"There is no need to avoid public areas. For all public and residential spaces exposed to confirmed 2019 Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) cases, NEA officers have been deployed to supervise the cleaning and disinfection works, to ensure that they were performed in accordance with NEA guidelines. 

As a precautionary measure to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-2019, NEA has issued sanitation and hygiene advisories to premises and facilities with high public access Ð such as hotels, commercial buildings, FB outlets (including hawker centres), and Town Councils. Officers from NEA and the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) have been visiting hawker centres, to guide hawkers on the proper cleaning and disinfection of their premises. Town Councils have also stepped up on their cleaning and disinfection regime of common areas, to ensure a high level of public health hygiene.

We would like to remind everyone to always observe good hygiene practices, like properly binning used tissues and waste, keeping dining tables clean, and returning trays along with soiled crockery after meals, to keep viruses at bay.

We also advise members of the public to not speculate and/or spread unfounded rumours. Please visit this page (www.moh.gov.sg) for updates on COVID-19 situation.",coronavirus

Personnel responsible for cleaning and disinfection of areas frequently used by the confirmed case, need to wear PPE consisting of: disposable long-sleeved gowns, disposable gloves, eye goggles or face shields, and N95 masks. Once soiled or damaged, gloves should be removed and discarded, and a new pair used after they have washed their hands with soap and water. It is important that cleaners observe strict hand hygiene and not touch any part of their face.
After cleaning and disinfection has been completed, cleaning personnel should remove their PPE, and immediately wash their hands with soap and water. For more information, please refer to the Interim guidelines for environmental cleaning and disinfection of areas exposed to confirmed case(s) of COVID-19 in non-healthcare premises.
