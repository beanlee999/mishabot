Question,,Answer
What is the phased resumption of face-to-face lessons for primary schools? When will my child return to school?,MOE/001,"MOE had earlier implemented Home-Based Learning (HBL) in primary schools and Special Education (SPED) schools to reduce the possible disruption to the cohort taking the PSLE and as an additional precautionary measure.

MOE will progressively bring Primary 1 to 6 students back to school for face-to-face lessons from Monday, 11 October 2021, to ensure physical schooling resumes in a safe manner. This is in line with our approach to minimise prolonged HBL where possible, for the social-emotional well-being of students.

To ensure that Safe Management Measures (SMMs) can be implemented effectively as students return to school, MOE will phase the return of students from Term 4 Week 5:

Primary 3 to 6 students returning from Monday, 11 October.
Primary 1 and 2 students to continue with HBL on Monday, 11 and Tuesday, 12 October, and return to school for face-to-face lessons only from Wednesday, 13 October.
SPED schools will be provided with more details on the phased return of students."

Why is MOE not extending HBL when the daily COVID-19 community cases remain high and most primary school students are not vaccinated?,MOE/002,"In line with Singapore's transition towards COVID resilience, we cannot be having HBL on a prolonged basis and indefinitely delay the re-opening of our schools.

For Primary 6

Similar to the arrangements for the 2020 year-end national examinations, Primary 6 students will go on a study break prior to the PSLE from 25 to 29 September 2021. This is to minimise the risk of school-based transmissions and reduce the number of students placed on Quarantine Order (QO) or Leave of Absence (LOA) prior to the examination.

For Primary 1 to 5

To better ensure that the PSLE written exams are conducted with minimum disruption, and also as an added precautionary measure for our younger students, we will also implement a Home-Based Learning (HBL) period for all Primary 1 to 5 students this year, from 27 September 2021 to 7 October 2021.

For Primary 1 to 6

There will be an extension of the HBL period for Primary 1 to 6, to include 7 October 2021, whereby Children’s Day celebrations will be held virtually on that day.

Is the 3-day PSLE study break new? Why do we need to implement a Home-Based Learning period for Primary 1 to 5 students this year?,MOE/010,"Similar to the arrangements for the 2020 year-end national examinations, Primary 6 students will go on a study break prior to the PSLE.

This is to reduce the risk of COVID-19 cases in schools just before the PSLE, and the number of Primary 6 students that need to be given QO which will mean they miss sitting for the exams. With rising community cases, a period of HBL for the primary school students will also reduce the number who need to be quarantined with a caregiver, which would be disruptive to families."

Can private candidates take national exams if they are on MC with covid symptoms?,MOE/015,"With the latest updates to the national COVID-19 isolation and testing protocols, MOE and SEAB have updated the examination arrangements for candidates taking their upcoming GCE-Level national year-end examinations, starting from 11 October 2021.

Health Risk Warning

Candidates on HRW who are well will be allowed to sit for their national year-end examinations, including the science practical examinations, and can take public transport to and from their examination venue. They should meet the following requirements:

Inform schools of their intent to sit for their examinations;
Ensure that they meet MOH's test protocol requirements, i.e.:
Testing negative for ART on the first day;
Testing negative for ART on the day of their examinations, before leaving their home;
Show a photo of their ART kits with negative test result and date of ART taken indicated on the test kit (candidate's ID must be placed next to their ART kit in the photo) to the invigilators.
Medical Leave

Candidates who are on medical leave will be allowed to sit for the national year-end examinations if they have fully recovered. If the candidate is symptomatic and has been prescribed a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test by a healthcare professional to assess for COVID-19 infection, the candidate should continue to self-isolate till the PCR result is out and is negative.

On the day of examination, candidates must take a self-swab ART at home and show a photo of their ART kits with negative result, with date of ART taken indicated on the test kit, that are placed next to their ID to the invigilators on arrival.

Why did MOE and SEAB decide to remove CLT from GCE level examinations? What are the CLT to be removed?,MOE/020,"With evolving COVID-19 situation including more infectious variants of the virus, we have seen more confirmed COVID-19 cases among students and staff, which led to some schools moving to Home-Based Learning (HBL) to safeguard the safety and well-being of the school community. As HBL may happen occasionally if there is a public health need to do so, students' learning may be disrupted and well-being impacted, especially for the graduating cohorts. After careful consideration of these factors, we will remove the CLT from the Singapore-Cambridge GCE N(A)-, N(T)-, O- and A-level examinations.

As facial expressions will not be taken into consideration for the assessment, candidates will not be disadvantaged by the wearing of surgical masks during oral examinations. Oral examiners will take the special circumstance of mask-wearing into consideration when assessing the candidates.

In addition, the following processes will be in place to ensure that oral examiners and candidates can hear each other clearly, and that the wearing of surgical mask does not inhibit pronunciation and articulation.

Before the start of the examination, oral examiners will ask each candidate to state his/her name and school loudly, to ensure that they can hear each other clearly.
During the examination, candidates can request for the oral examiners to repeat their questions and/or speak louder.

Any decision to remove CLT is considered carefully as it can affect students' progression to the next course of study and the design of the examinations, i.e. students having fewer or no optional questions to choose from.

Can my child use a face shield instead of a face mask in school?,MOE/030,"COVID-19 is spread predominantly through droplets. The design of face shields typically leaves a gap between the face shield and the face which droplets can pass through, whereas masks that are worn closely and completely over the nose and mouth do not have such gaps. Hence, MOH had announced that from 2 June, masks will now be required as the default when we are outside our home.

However, MOH also recognises that in some situations, the wearing of face masks may not be practical, and exemption has been given for certain groups of students/children as follows:

Children twelve years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time;
Older students who have certified health conditions that may result in breathing or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time. This includes some students with special needs that make it challenging for them to wear face masks.
For these children, face shields could be an option and is not mandatory.

Schools will also allow primary school students and MK children to use face shields for short periods of time if the children have difficulties wearing face masks for long periods."

"Given the number of students that have been infected with COVID-19, why is MOE resuming more activities such as CCAs in secondary schools, JCs, MI and IHLs?",MOE/031,"The majority of student and school staff cases were infected by their household members or through social interactions outside of the school or IHL setting. Safe management measures (SMMs) in schools and IHLs have largely been effective in helping to ensure the safety of the school community.

Since the start of the vaccination exercise for students from 1 June 2021, most eligible students aged 12 and above in our primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges (JCs), Millennia Institute (MI), SPED schools and IHLs have received their first dose, and it is expected that about 90% of these students will have received both doses of the vaccine by early September.

In view of the progressive increase in the proportion of students who are fully vaccinated, we are gradually allowing more activities to resume in secondary schools, JCs, MI, SPED schools (for the senior/secondary sections) and IHLs, as these student activities are essential for learning, as well as the social and emotional development of our students.

Given that most primary school students are not age-eligible for vaccination and remain unvaccinated, Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) will continue to remain suspended for primary schools for the time being. SMMs and ringfencing measures will continue to be implemented in schools to keep students safe.

MOE will continue to monitor the situation closely and review our plans in tandem with the national posture."

What are MOE's considerations in deciding whether to shift all schools to Full Home-Based Learning (HBL)? Under what circumstances will MOE roll out nationwide Full HBL?,MOE/035,"As far as possible, our approach has been to keep schools open, as we recognise that HBL cannot be a full substitute for the school-based learning experience. Some curricular components are better carried out in school such as practical work and physical education. School-based learning also offers a wider range of learning opportunities beyond the academics such as CCAs.

We had shifted all schools to Full HBL in May for 1.5 weeks, as part of a stepping up of precautionary measures to safeguard the well-being of all students and staff, given the sharp increase in the number of community cases and vaccination rate was still low in the community.

Nevertheless, where necessary, MOE is prepared to have specific schools, or as a last resort, for all schools to move to Full HBL should the situation warrant, carefully balancing the considerations for risk management and the impact of the disruptions caused."

Can students engage in strenuous activities after their vaccination?,MOE/044,"Given the emerging data on the small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis* observed after vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the Expert Committee on COVID-19 vaccination recommends that all vaccinated persons, in particular adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their first and second vaccination doses.

In line with the Expert Committee’s recommendation, students should also avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their first and second doses.

Examples (non-exhaustive) of strenuous physical activity to avoid are:

Swimming
Cycling
Running
Lifting heavy weights
Competitive sports
Ball/racket games
During this time, students should seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats.

Students should inform their PE, relevant CCA and other teachers about the date of their vaccination so that they will be exempted from physical activities for a week.

While most persons with vaccine-related myocarditis observed locally and internationally have mild symptoms and make an uneventful recovery, it is possible that the condition may be aggravated by factors or strenuous activities that may affect the heart.

*Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory conditions affecting the heart muscles and the outer lining of the heart respectively. Patients often present with symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats."

What are the common side effects that my child may experience after the COVID-19 vaccination? Would my child experience different side effects from adults?,MOE/047,"According to MOH, the side effects observed in children are similar to that in the adult population, and your child may experience more side effects after the second dose of vaccination. These side effects may be experienced when the body is responding to the vaccine, and they are usually mild to moderate which should resolve in a few days.

The table below lists some common side effects that have been reported with the vaccine, and how to manage them:

Side Effects	How to Manage
Pain, redness, swelling at the injection site	Fever medication as needed, according to child’s weight. Those with fever are advised to self-isolate at home until the fever subsides.



Fever, chills
Headache, muscle pain, joint pain
Tiredness	Rest
Lymph node swelling at neck or arms	Usually gets better by itself in a week or so
Bring your child to see a doctor if:

The side effects persist for more than 48 hours or get worse; and
Respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, sore throat, shortness of breath or loss of sense of taste and smells develops.
In rare cases, this vaccine can cause a severe allergic reaction. Signs of a severe allergic reaction include difficulties in breathing, swelling of face, throat, eyes or lips, fast heartbeat, dizziness and weakness, a bad rash all over the body. If your child experiences a severe allergic reaction, seek medical attention immediately. Please call 995 or seek emergency treatment immediately."

"Is my child eligible for the vaccination if he or she has allergies, medical conditions or is taking certain prescription drugs?",MOE/048,"According to MOH, if your child has a history of allergy (including anaphylaxis) to medications, food, insect bite or unknown triggers, they can still be safely vaccinated. However, if they have a known allergy to other vaccines or to one of the mRNA vaccine's components, they should not receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for now.

Most individuals with common conditions (e.g. asthma, eczema, obesity) can be vaccinated. People with weakened immune systems, either from illness or medication, may still receive the vaccine because it is not a live vaccine, i.e. a vaccine that uses a weakened form of a germ to prompt an immune response. However, people with severely weakened immune system (e.g. recent transplant in the past 3 months) should not receive the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines.

If your child recently received other vaccinations, he/she should wait two weeks before seeking the COVID-19 vaccine.

If your child has a medical condition that is not stable or is getting worse, he/she should postpone seeking the COVID-19 vaccination until his/her medical condition is better controlled. If your child has cancer and is on active chemotherapy, you should consult your child's cancer specialist to discuss if or when your child can be vaccinated.

Parents are always encouraged to speak with their child's doctor/paediatrician if they have any questions or concerns."

This will only be for students who have not yet booked appointments via the National Appointment System (NAS). Students with NAS bookings should honour their appointments and will not be eligible for the facilitated vaccination, as they have already taken up a booking slot at a vaccination centre.

*Students are encouraged to approach their school directly for further details. Please note that there are fixed time periods for the student-facilitated vaccination exercise, to avoid clashes with national or school examinations."
Which vaccination centres are offering the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccines?,MOE/051,"Each vaccination centre will only stock and administer one type of vaccine. You may refer to the MOH website to check which COVID-19 vaccine is being offered at the vaccination centre.

As the vaccination capacity of each vaccination centre is not the same, the waiting time for vaccination will differ between vaccination centres. Do check for the availability of appointment slots in other centres if you are unable to secure your desired vaccination appointment dates at the nearest centre."
How do I ensure that I have selected the correct vaccination centre for my child/myself?,MOE/052,"The National Appointment System will only show vaccination centres carrying the appropriate vaccine for individuals based on their age as declared on the system at point of booking.

Even though there are fewer children who have been ill with COVID-19 as compared to adults, the vaccination can help protect your child from getting COVID-19, and help to reduce the severity of the disease even for those small number of cases where the vaccinated individual ended up being infected.

In addition, getting your child vaccinated helps to protect those around your child from being infected, including family members, especially more vulnerable persons like elderly relatives or persons with weakened immune systems.

Having the vaccine may also give parents and children peace of mind to return to more typical activities in school."

What adjustments have been made to ensure that students are not unduly penalised in terms of their co-curricular records and LEAPS 2.0 attainment?,MOE/082,"MOE has implemented a set of measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the co-curricular records of primary school and pre-university students, as well as the LEAPS 2.0 attainment for secondary school students.

For the LEAPS 2.0 framework, which recognises the holistic development of secondary students, adjustments have been made to the four domains – Achievement, Leadership, Participation and Service – so that students will continue to be recognised for their involvement in co-curricular activities (CCA).

Under the Achievement domain, MOE has implemented a special provision to recognise all students for Representation and Accomplishment as long as they have been selected to represent their school this year for any competition, performance or event (e.g. National School Games, Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation etc.). This is regardless of the completion status and outcome of their involvement in these activities.

Under the Leadership domain, schools will continue to recognise school, class and CCA-based leadership appointments, taking into account how the various leadership responsibilities might have been rescoped to continue to allow meaningful learning to take place. For example, for Uniformed Groups, badgework and promotion requirements will be adjusted to allow students to pursue their rank promotions and badges through online learning modules.

Under the Participation domain, students' CCA attendance will be pro-rated based on the total number of CCA sessions that have been conducted by the school. Students who were absent with valid reasons due to disruptions caused by COVID-19 will not be penalised.

Under the Service domain, schools will continue to recognise students for their involvement in Values in Action (VIA) activities and projects, time spent on planning, discussing and refining as well as reflection components of their VIA project."

How many ART kits will my child be receiving?,MOE/086,"As Singapore transits to being a COVID-19 resilient nation, we recognise that the students in our MOE Kindergartens (MKs), primary schools and Special Education (SPED) schools (with primary/junior sections) are mostly not yet medically eligible for vaccination as they are below 12 years old, and can only rely on adherence to Safe Management Measures (SMMs) and testing to mitigate the risk of transmission.

As part of enhanced testing efforts to ensure the school environment remains safe, MOE will be distributing Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits from 13 September to all students and staff in MKs, primary schools and SPED schools (primary/junior sections).

Each student and staff will receive three ART kits, in addition to those that each household will receive as part of the nationwide distribution exercise.

The ART kits will allow students to do a quick test on their own (or with parents/guardians' supervision/assistance if necessary) when there is possible exposure or suspicion of possible infection. This includes students who:

are identified by their school as possible contacts of a confirmed COVID-19 case but were not placed on Quarantine Order;
are on Approved Absence as they were feeling unwell with flu-like symptoms, but were not swabbed when visiting the doctor; or have unwell household members with flu-like symptoms."
What happens if my child's ART swab test result is positive?,MOE/087,"If your child has conducted an ART swab test and the result tests positive or invalid twice, please bring your child to take a confirmatory government-funded Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test at the nearest Swab-and-Send-Home Public Health Preparedness Clinic (SASH PHPC) offering pediatric swab tests for children under the age of 13.

For your child's visit to the SASH PHPC clinic, they should bring along (1) a photo of the positive ART test result with the child's identification document (ID) (e.g. NRIC/passport) captured within the same image and (2) the child's physical identification document (ID).

For children aged 6 years and below, parents/guardians may use the child's Birth Certificate or Health Booklet as their identification document (ID).

Parents/guardians may visit https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg to locate a SASH PHPC clinic that offers government-funded PCR swab tests for children under the age of 13. Please call ahead to confirm that the clinic can offer the relevant test during your visit (e.g. paediatric swab tests for children under the age of 13)."
Will there be assistance provided to teach parents/guardians on how to conduct an ART swab test?,MOE/088,"MOE Kindergartens, primary schools and SPED schools (primary/junior sections) will be engaging parents/guardians in a one-time familiarisation exercise to help them learn how their children can conduct an ART swab at home. Specific arrangements will be shared by schools in due course.

This is to ensure that parents/guardians and children are familiar with the use of ART kits, as these will be used more regularly in the coming months to facilitate the safe return of students to school."

What measures will school-based Student Care Centres (SCC) and Kindergarten Care (KCare) put in place to reduce intermingling of students?,MOE/090,"Schools will work with the SCC operators to put in place safe management measures to reduce the intermingling of students from different levels. Students will be in fixed groups based on their class and level and allocated designated rooms, preferably on different levels, to minimise contact. There will be no intermingling between groups and no group work. The same SCC staff will also be deployed to look after each group of students.

The same principle to avoid inter-mingling will apply to KCare. Where possible, we will:

Keep children and staff of the K1 and K2 levels segregated;
Keep children segregated by class;
Ensure children of K1 and K2 levels do not mix by staggering snack times;
Have fixed deployment of KCare staff to each class/level."

What are the safe management measures put in place in schools?,MOE/093,"Safe management measures in schools will continue to include the following:

Screening

Once-daily temperature-taking and visual screening for all students and staff. A second temperature-taking would only be required for primary school students attending Student Care Centres (SCC).
Students and staff who are unwell with flu-like symptoms, are required to stay away from school. They should seek medical attention immediately and be tested for COVID-19. Unwell individuals should remain at home until they are tested negative for COVID-19.
Students and staff who have household members on Quarantine Order/Stay Home Notice or have children or adult household members with flu-like symptoms such as fever and cough, are required to stay away from school.
Students should have their TraceTogether token or app with them throughout the school day to facilitate accurate contact tracing, should the need arise. However, students will not be denied entry to school if they forget to bring their TT token. Do note that TT Tokens or Apps will be required for student participation in out-of-school activities where SE check-ins are carried out via TT-only SE.
Hygiene

Frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces and disinfection of the premises to be done daily.
Students will continue to practise frequent hand-washing throughout the school day and wipe down of tables and shared equipment after use.
Mask wearing

All students and staff will be required to wear masks at all times. Students and staff should wear masks with good filtration capability such as surgical masks or reusable masks of equivalent effectiveness that are made of at least two layers of fabric.
Young children are to wear masks, unless they are unable to due to pertinent special needs or medical conditions.
For physical education classes, primary schools will only conduct individual mask-off activities outdoors, while secondary schools/JCs/MI can conduct mask-off activities in groups of up to two outdoors.
Mask-off music and drama classes will be suspended. Schools with O/A-level Music candidates will continue with examination preparations with testing.
Schools will adhere to guidelines on ventilation for regular air flow exchange and the use of air purifiers in air-conditioned venues.
Safe Distancing

All activities to be grouped by class, with the exception of banded classes for MTL, Subject-Based Banding.
Fixed exam-style classroom seating.
Group work for up to two persons will be allowed in class. Masks are to be kept on at all times for such activities.
Maximum of 50 persons for all activities, including lectures in school.
Staggered arrival, dismissal and/or recess timings to reduce congestion and intermingling between students in school.
Fixed seating with 1m spacing during recess. If not possible, students could eat in classrooms or at appropriate venues with 1m spacing."
Can all Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and external activities continue?,MOE/094,"All in-person CCAs and non-essential enrichment will be suspended till further notice. Where possible and meaningful, CCAs may be reformatted and conducted online (eCCA). External activities such as external CCAs and learning journeys will remain suspended.

MOE will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and provide updates if there are further changes to the arrangements for school activities."

Consistent with usual school practice, students who are unable to attend CCA due to valid reasons can be excused."
How can MOE confirm that there will not be a cluster in schools with confirmed case(s)?,MOE/096,"MOE will closely monitor the students and staff who were in contact with the confirmed case(s). As a precautionary measure, they will be issued a 14-day Leave of Absence, to minimise the risks of further transmission in schools. The affected schools will also be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.

These measures have proven to be effective in limiting the transmission of virus in our schools. Students and staff who are unwell know that they should not be going to school. Our teachers also carefully monitor themselves and their students, and any staff or student showing symptoms will be immediately isolated and sent to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Our schools and teachers will continue to implement the necessary safe management and precautionary measures, to reduce risks as much as possible."
What action will MOE take if there are any confirmed case(s)/clusters in school?,MOE/097,"If there is a new confirmed case in the school, our schools will take the necessary measures to safeguard students and staff and curb the risk of any transmission, which include issuing Leave of Absence (LOA) quickly to close contacts, and to students from the same classes or CCA groups of confirmed cases.

MOE will work closely with MOH to identify all close contacts of the confirmed case and determine whether staff, students and visitors will need to undergo precautionary swab tests. Close contacts will also be issued Quarantine Orders (QOs) by MOH.

Any staff or students who show any symptoms will be required to go to their nearest doctor for treatment and, if necessary, swab tests.

These measures will help to break the chain of transmission, while supporting our students to ensure they can continue their learning. When the school's situation has stabilised, students and staff can return to the school to continue face-to-face lessons (arrangement will depend on the situation)."
There will be a small number of students with SEN who are neither able to wear a mask nor a face shield. Will exceptions be made for such students whether in SPED or Mainstream Schools?,MOE/098,"Most students with SEN can and therefore should wear a mask or face shield. Some may have sensory challenges which cause distress when wearing a mask or face shield. Hence we will exercise flexibility in enforcement. Parents should obtain a letter from a qualified medical/allied health professional if their child with SEN is unable to wear either a mask or face shield.

For specific groups of students with SEN, such as those with hearing loss and who lip-read, there will be some allowance for them, as well as their teachers and peers, to adopt the most appropriate safe management measures while allowing teaching and learning to continue. For example, during lessons and communication, these students, their teachers and their peers may need to wear face shields to facilitate lip-reading."

Why not reduce class sizes for better safe distancing? How about having morning and afternoon sessions?,MOE/099,"We had considered reducing class sizes and having morning and afternoon sessions to allow for better safe distancing. However, this is disruptive. Students will have different teachers and less time with the subject teachers since we would have to reduce periods to fit two sessions.

In addition, these measures may not be critical to manage risks in the school context at this juncture, as we have many other safe management measures in place. These include having students stick strictly to their classes, minimising contact between students in class, and emphasising good hygiene and proper mask-wearing in common areas. We will also maintain safe distancing through queue markers and alternate seating in canteens, plus stagger arrival and dismissal times to ease congestion."
Why are we not disinfecting shoes and clothing of students?,MOE/100,"MOH has shared that there is currently no evidence that spraying disinfectant on a fully clothed individual would 'disinfect' the individual. In addition, as the virus is carried within the airways of the infected person, spraying disinfectant onto the skin cannot eradicate it. The disinfectant may also cause skin irritation or other complications such as eczema."
How does MOE ensure safe management in school buses?,MOE/101,"School bus operators will be encouraged to implement fixed alternate seating as far as possible. If not possible, fixed seating arrangements will still be put in place. Just like on public transport, students will wear masks, remain in their seats and refrain from talking. Operators will continue to maintain a high standard of cleanliness of the buses.

Schools will also continue to work with their school bus operators to ensure they check with students if they feel unwell, or have flu-like symptoms, and if any of the adults in their household has such symptoms. Students who report so should not board the bus but stay at home."
Will there be testing of SPED school personnel?,MOE/102,"Students in our SPED schools, just like their peers in mainstream schools, generally do not need physical assistance. But there are some SPED students who are physically frail and would need help from the staff. For example, students with multiple disabilities may need staff to help move them from a wheelchair to another piece of equipment. We will be looking into testing staff who work closely with the more vulnerable students."
Will students need to be assisted when doing ART tested at SPED schools?,MOE/102,"Students in our SPED schools, just like their peers in mainstream schools, generally do not need physical assistance.

What school facilities will be open for public use under the Dual-Use Scheme (DUS)?,MOE/104,"In line with the progressive resumption of activities in Singapore, SportSG and MOE will reopen selected DUS Chargeable Fields (CFs) and Indoor Sport Halls (ISHs) for public use from 21 August 2021 onwards. Bookings can be made in advance through the ActiveSG app from 17 August 2021.

All other DUS free-to-play (FTP) facilities will remain closed to the public till further notice.

For more information on the DUS facilities that will be open for public use, as well as the booking details, please refer to https://myactivesg.com.

MOE and SportSG will continue to review the DUS arrangements as the COVID-19 situation evolves."
Do MOE's precautionary measures apply to school vendors?,MOE/105,"The precautionary measures schools have implemented to safeguard the well-being of students and staff also apply to school vendors. Temperature taking is conducted daily for vendors, including canteen vendors, cleaners, security guards, KCare and Student Care Centre staff. Individuals who have a temperature of 38oC or higher, or who exhibit flu-like symptoms, will be asked to seek medical assistance immediately. Vendors who operate outside schools, such as school bus vendors and coaches, have also been advised to adopt good personal hygiene practices and seek immediate medical attention should they feel unwell. Vendors are required to inform the school should they or any of their staff go on medical leave/QO/LOA/SHN."
"What are the updates to precautionary measures for MOE Kindergartens (MK), schools and institutes of higher learning, and when do these updates take effect?",MOE/106,"In line with the Ministry of Health's (MOH) updates to the national COVID-19 testing and isolation protocols, MOE will be updating the precautionary measures currently implemented in MKs, primary and secondary schools, Special Education (SPED) schools, junior colleges (JCs)/ Millennia Institute (MI), as well as Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs).

From 11 October 2021, MOH will issue 7-day Health Risk Warning (HRW) to students in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, in line with Protocol 3 of the 1-2-3 protocols#. Such students can return to school during the 7 days if they continue to be well and have a negative Antigen Rapid Test (ART) result before they leave for school daily.

MOE will no longer issue Leave of Absence (LOA) and Approved Absence (AA) for MOE Kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools (including SPED schools), JCs / MI. This means students and staff currently under existing Quarantine Orders, LOA or AA can return to school for lessons as long as they are well and have a negative ART test result on the day they go to school. IHLs will similarly take alignment with MOH's revised protocols. This is in line with the national approach to living with COVID-19.

The table below provides an overview of the updated categories of precautionary measures in schools and IHLs, in effect from 11 October 2021:

Category	Arrangements
Confirmed Case	Not allowed to attend school / campus until the end of Isolation Order.
Stay-Home Notice (SHN)	Not allowed to return to school / campus until the end of SHN.
Health Risk Warning (HRW)	Follow national Protocol 3 and allowed to return to school / campus after the first negative ART self-test, and negative ART results daily for the next 7 days, prior to leaving home.
#For more information on the 1-2-3 protocols, please refer to Annex C in MOH's press release on 9 October."
My child has been placed on Quarantine Order (QO)/Leave of Absence (LOA)/Approved Absence (AA) earlier. Under what circumstances can my child return to school?,MOE/107,"Students who have been issued with QO, LOA or AA may return to school from 11 October as long as they are well and with a negative Antigen Rapid Test (ART) result on the day they go to school."

What happens if there is a confirmed case in my child's class?,MOE/108,"For MOE Kindergartens and Primary Schools:

As MOE Kindergarten children and most primary school students are not vaccinated, MOE Kindergartens and primary schools will continue to actively identify close contacts of COVID-19 cases in school and require them to undergo regular testing while waiting for the issuance of a Health Risk Warning (HRW) by MOH. Under this arrangement for Close Contact Testing (CCT):

Identified students should stay at home but may return to school if they are well and have a negative ART result before they leave for school daily.
As this is meant to be a bridging measure while awaiting the issuance of HRW by MOH, students will be placed on CCT for a period of 5 days.
If HRW is not issued during the 5 days, the CCT will be lifted, and the student need not perform further testing.
In line with the move to living with COVID-19, school staff would not be calling parents to inform them of CCT. Schools will use electronic means (e.g. Parents Gateway or email) instead. Schools will conduct deep cleaning of the facilities and will inform you if the class has to be on 1 day of HBL to do so.

For Secondary Schools/Junior Colleges/Millennia Institute:

What is a Health Risk Warning (HRW)?,MOE/109,"Previously, contacts of COVID-19 cases were differentiated into various risk levels and there were several measures imposed, such as Quarantine Order (QO), Health Risk Alert (HRA), and Health Risk Warning (HRW). There will now be a single approach – a HRW that lasts seven days from the day of its issuance, that is based on ART self-testing. It will comprise following national Protocol 3:

Upon being notified of the HRW (Day 1), the person should immediately self-isolate, and test himself with an ART on the day of the HRW issuance and upload the Day 1 ART result based on the instruction in the HRW notification.
The person on HRW can continue with normal activities for the day if the test is negative.
For subsequent days, i.e. Day 2 to 7, the person on HRW should test ART negative on same day before going out.
If the person on HRW tests positive on any of these ART tests, he should follow national Protocol 2#.
On Day 7, he must test himself with an ART, and if the test is negative, there is no further need for tests after that.
#For more information on the 1-2-3 protocols, please refer to Annex C in MOH's press release on 9 October."
What should my child do if an ART positive test result is obtained when he/she is well?,MOE/110,"Students who are well and who have been administered the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) and obtained a positive test result, should self-isolate at home for 72 hours before repeating the ART. Students may resume daily activities, including coming to school, if the second ART is negative. If the second ART is also positive, students should continue to self-isolate and repeat the ART daily until it is negative.

Students and their household members should seek medical attention immediately if they are unwell with flu-like symptoms. As part of being socially responsible, students who are unwell should not return to school and should practise good personal hygiene both in school and at home."

PEIs are strongly encouraged to take reference from the plans and safe management measures for ECDA-registered preschools, MOE schools and IHLs, if they wish to adopt measures that are tighter than national SMMs.

PEIs with clarifications should approach SkillsFuture Singapore at CPE_Registration@ssg.gov.sg."
What are the safe management measures that should be implemented for tuition and enrichment centres that are allowed to continue on-site instruction?,MOE/125,"In line with the national posture, all tuition and enrichment centres must ensure that work-from-home is the default arrangement for employees who are able to do so. During this period, the 10-day snap work-from-home regime will be suspended. MOE strongly encourages that all tuition and enrichment classes be conducted online.

For centres that are allowed to continue on-site instruction, to reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19, they are required to abide by the nationwide safe management measures for workplaces. These include the use of SafeEntry to support contact tracing for all employees, wearing of masks at all times, no social gatherings at the workplace and regular cleaning of common facilities and high-touch areas. Employers should continue to implement flexible working hours and stagger the start times of employees who need to return to the workplace. Employees who are unable to work from home are strongly encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART), to keep the workplace safe. Employees who are able to work from home but need to return to the workplace for adhoc reasons may do so after testing negative via ART before returning onsite. Details are available at the GoBusiness website (https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/general).

As part of Singapore's national efforts to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19, enterprises in the Private Tuition and Enrichment Sector are required to comply with the FET 7-day regime, as well as the VoRT regime for onsite employees. The latest details on the two regimes are on: https://go.gov.sg/tuition-enrichment-fet.

As a default, the following SMMs apply to all centres conducting on-site instruction (whether indoors or outdoors and regardless of activity), except where there are additional SMMs that apply for higher-risk activities such as sports or physical activity, dance, singing, the playing of instruments that require the intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind/brass instruments), voice training, and speech and drama classes (please refer here for details on additional SMMs for high movement activities or activities which carry a higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread, and here for classes that involve mask-off activities).

Safe distancing. Safe distancing measures for centres which are allowed to continue on-premise instruction are:
Students: Centres must ensure safe distancing between students by putting up appropriate floor demarcations and/or physical barriers, e.g. using safety tape. There must also be strict separation between students in different classrooms at all times, with no intermingling.
As a default, centres must ensure that all students maintain safe distancing of at least 1m at all times, with strictly no physical interaction between students.
If it is not possible to apply 1m safe distancing between students and some interaction is unavoidable, centres may instead organise students into groups of no more than 2 students, with strictly no physical interaction or intermingling between different groups. Centres must strictly maintain a minimum of 1m spacing between groups, although MOE advises 2m spacing between groups as a best practice.
Tutors/instructors: Tutors/instructors are advised to minimise contact with students, If some interaction is unavoidable, contact with students should be transient, and they should remain at the front of the class as much as is practicable.
Capacity: No single room within a centre should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors, even as the above measures are adopted.
Centres are also reminded that per MOM's guidelines for workplaces, should there be staff deployed on site, centres must ensure that there is be no cross-deployment across worksites. No staff should work at more than one worksite to reduce the risk of infection caused by inter-mingling. More information on prevailing workplace SMMs can be found on the MOM website (https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures).
Health declarations. Centres should not permit students who are placed on Leave of Absence or Approved Absence by their schools, or students and staff who are on Health Risk Warning, Health Risk Alert, Stay Home Notice, or Home Quarantine Order to enter the centre. We also advise centres to watch out for staff and students with fever or respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, breathlessness, runny nose, loss of sense of smell, cough, or sore throat. Staff and students with the above symptoms or who are unwell should be advised to leave the centre and see a doctor immediately, and should not be allowed to attend lessons. As a best practice, centres should also check if a family member living in the same household is unwell. If so, the child should not attend lessons in person.
Disinfection of surfaces. All surfaces in classrooms must be thoroughly disinfected between classes. Sharing of all equipment (e.g. props, microphones) should be avoided as far as possible. If this cannot be done, the equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and/or disinfected before being handled or used by others. However, please note that sharing of wind/brass instruments or parts thereof (e.g. mouthpieces, reeds) is not allowed.
Masks must be worn as a default at all times, except for persons allowed to use face shields instead of masks (e.g. persons with health conditions resulting in breathing/medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period). Instructors are expected to wear a surgical mask or reusable masks of equivalent effectiveness at all times.
Class timings. Centres must allocate at least 15 minutes between classes. This is to allow adequate time to disinfect classroom surfaces, and to ensure strict separation of individuals from different classes. Centres should also work out attendance and dismissal arrangements that help avoid congestion of individuals in or outside the centre.
Ventilation. All premises should abide by the latest guidance on improving ventilation and indoor air quality in buildings amid the COVID-19 situation, available on the NEA website.
Centres should also abide by other sector-specific Safe Management Measures available on the GoBusiness website, and to prevailing circulars issued by the Government."
"Some tuition and enrichment classes involve high movement activities (e.g. sports, dance), or activities which carry a higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread (e.g. singing, wind/brass instruments). What additional safe management measures should be implemented?",MOE/126,"Additional safe management measures may apply for these classes, subject to different class size and group size limits, depending on the activity, setting, and vaccination status of students.

For all sport or physical activity classes, as well as outdoor dance classes, please refer to the advisory issued by Sport Singapore.

For indoor dance classes, singing, the playing of instruments that require the intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind/brass instruments), voice training, and speech and drama classes, please refer to the advisory issued by the National Arts Council.

For more details on the implementation of FET, please refer to the notification issued by National Arts Council, and the notification issued by ActiveSG."
What are the additional safe management measures for classes that involve mask-off activities?,MOE/127,"All activities involving mask-off activities are subject to additional safe management measures (on top of the prevailing safe management measures that all classes are required to comply with).

For outdoor classes, the class size must be limited to a maximum of 50 persons (including the instructor), with group sizes of no more than 2 persons.
There must be at least 1m safe distance between individuals who are masked. For individuals who are unmasked, they must maintain a 2m safe distance with the next individual.
Additionally, there must be a minimum of 3m spacing between each group. The groups should not intermingle before, during, and after the class.
For indoor classes, class size must be limited to a maximum of 30 persons (including the instructor), with:
Group sizes of no more than 2 persons, provided that all individuals in the class are vaccinated.
There must be at least 1m safe distance between individuals who are masked. For individuals who are unmasked, they must maintain a 2m safe distance with the next individual.
Additionally, there must be a minimum of 3m spacing between each group. The groups should not intermingle before, during, and after the class.
Where there are individuals who are not vaccinated, indoor classes are to be suspended.
An individual is considered vaccinated if he/ she has been:

Fully vaccinated, i.e. has received the full regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnatry, Moderna or World Health Organisation's Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines, with an additional two weeks for the vaccine to be fully effective;
Recovered from COVID-19; or
Has obtained a negative result on a pre-event test taken in the past 24 hours before the expected end of the event."
What are the safe management measures that should be implemented for in person lessons operating out of private residences?,MOE/128,"MOE strongly encourages that all tuition and enrichment classes be conducted online. Home-based tuition/enrichment that conduct in-person lessons will be subject to the prevailing national group size limit (currently two) and number of unique household visitors allowed per day (also currently two). Individuals who visit private residences to provide tuition and enrichment are also subject to the prevailing national limit for number of social household visits allowed (currently one). The prevailing national limits can be found at https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory.

In addition, home ventilation should be improved by opening doors and windows. Fans can be used to promote air circulation when needed."
Can tuition and enrichment centres that are allowed to conduct face-to-face classes switch to online learning?,MOE/129,"Yes, tuition and enrichment centres providing face-to-face classes can consider switching to online lessons. Centres should review the safe management measures that they are able to put in place and can make their own business decisions regarding the conduct of online learning, taking into consideration the efficacy of instruction and the needs and expectations of students/parents."
"Can employees of private tuition and enrichment centres continue to work at the workplace, even if centres have switched to online learning?",MOE/130,"Tuition and enrichment centres are required to abide by the nationwide safe management measures for workplaces. Tele-conferencing should be used in place of in-person meetings as far as possible. Where employees can perform their work by telecommuting from home, employers must ensure that they do so."
"Are private schools, including tuition and enrichment centres, allowed to hold year-end concerts or performances on their premises?",MOE/131,"All indoor live performances by tuition and enrichment centres should continue to be deferred/postponed until further notice, to reduce the risk of transmission."
Are all tutors/instructors/staff at private tuition or enrichment centres required to undergo Fast and Easy Testing (FET) or the Vaccinate or Regular Test (VoRT) regimes?,MOE/132,"As part of Singapore's national efforts to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19, enterprises in the Private Tuition and Enrichment Sector are required to comply with the FET 7-day regime, as well as the VoRT regime.

Can private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions be held in external venues (e.g. function rooms)?,MOE/133,"Private tuition/enrichment classes, and training sessions by the Institutes of Higher Learning and SSG-funded training providers, can be conducted at external venues, if those venues are open. Such external venues may include condominium function rooms, private conference and meeting rooms, etc.

Conduct of in-person lessons is subject to premise capacity caps and safe management measures. Private providers should approach premise owners for advice on the capacity caps for their respective venues. No single room should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors/trainers, subject to further capacity limits for masked sports/dance/speech/voice training/drama classes, or the premise capacity cap, whichever is lower.

There should be a wipe-down regimen after each use at such external venues. Private providers must also adhere to the safe management guidelines for private tuition/enrichment and CET courses, which are outlined in the FAQs within this section."
Will Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses for adults be allowed to continue?,MOE/134,"Yes, in-person classes catering exclusively to students older than 12 years old may continue in person, subject to prevailing safe management measures. However, MOE strongly encourages that these classes be conducted online.

For health and safety reasons, the maximum class size for all other in-person CET activities is capped at 50 persons (including the trainer(s)). For SSG-funded CET programmes, SSG's prevailing guideline for a maximum class size of 40 persons (excluding the trainer(s)) for course quality reasons remains and takes precedence. This is subject to safe management requirements and additional safe management measures specified here and here as applicable."
"Will the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system and the SafeEntry Gateway Device (SEGW) be implemented for tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers?",MOE/135,"On 4 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced that TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SafeEntry) will be implemented at all venues that experience higher throughput of visitors, and/or where people are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods from 17 May 2021. The TT programme and SafeEntry are important digital tools that enable contact tracers to quickly identify and isolate close contacts of COVID-19 cases. This helps to break transmission chains and prevent community outbreaks. TT tokens may be collected at designated collection points (please refer to https://token.gowhere.gov.sg for more information).

Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers must therefore ensure that TT-only SafeEntry is implemented in your premises, and that entry to your centres will be allowed only if the individual uses their TT App to scan the centre’s QR code or presents the QR code on the TT token to be scanned. This includes staff, students aged 7 years and above, parents and other visitors.

It is mandatory for all tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers to deploy SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) to facilitate SafeEntry (SE) check-in for students aged 7 years and above, parents, staff and visitors, and help users check that their TT token is working. Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers are reminded to download the SafeEntry (Business) app to use the SEGW function or register for a SEGW box on the SE website (go.gov.sg/gateway-overview). Centres should maintain attendance records for children below 7 to facilitate contact tracing if required.

At the point of entry into the centres, if any student forgets to bring their TT token, they should be asked to download the TT app on their phones before they are allowed entry. However, if the student is unable to do so (e.g. phone is out of battery), the student’s personal details should be noted down as a last resort, before the individual is granted entry. The centre should retain all such records for at least a month to facilitate contact tracing if necessary.

Business may refer to the SafeEntry User Guide for requirements on how to scan the TT tokens, available at https://www.safeentry.gov.sg (please navigate to Resources > User Guide > SafeEntry NRIC User Guide for Business). Updates may also be found at https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/media-hub/press-releases."

Why do we allow university dorms to be designated as Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs)? Will allowing this put the wider student population at risk?,MOE/141,"Currently, there are three university hostels designated as Government Quarantine Facilities (GQFs) – designated blocks at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Prince George's Park Residences, Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Graduate Hall 1, and Singapore Management University's (SMU) Blk 83 Prinsep St. They have always been part of the Government's national contingency plan for a disease outbreak. We are getting them ready to be on standby, should the number of people served with QO goes up. The designated hostels will only be primarily activated when a student in our educational institutions or schools is required to serve QOs and does not have suitable accommodation.

Persons served QOs are required to stay in their designated rooms at all times within the allocated quarantine period. They are not allowed to use common facilities within the GQF. There will be no visitors, and food and all necessary supplies will be delivered to them.

There are also security measures in place to ensure compliance to GQF guidelines. All staff working at the GQF are also provided with personal protective equipment, such as masks, as advised by the Ministry of Health (MOH). GQFs also undergo rigorous cleansing and hygiene regimes according to MOH and National Environment Agency (NEA) guidelines. In other words, the persons will not be mingling with the larger population around them."
